# hash-cracker

hash cracker is a multi-functional and compact...hash cracking tool...that supports dictionary attacks against three kinds of hashes: md5, sha1, sha256

the script uses the hashlib library to generate hashes and compares them with hashed entries from a wordlist

## usage

python3 hc.py --hashlist /path/to/hashes --dict /path/to/wordlist --type md5/sha1/sha256

note: my second tool! error handling and efficincy are a bit higher in this one
